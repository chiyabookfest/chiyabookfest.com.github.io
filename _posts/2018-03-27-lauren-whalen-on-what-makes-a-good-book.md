A great book surprises me and makes me think.
It challenges my perceptions and opinions, while also making me feel at home.
A great book keeps me up at night because I keep saying to myself "just one more chapter", even though I know I'm lying.
Related: a great book means I'm tired the next day, but it's completely worth it.
To quote 'The History Boys', a great book feels "like a hand has come out and taken yours."
