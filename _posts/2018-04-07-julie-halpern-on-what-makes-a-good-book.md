As a librarian, I think a great book is any book that gets read. If it does its job and transports the reader to another land or time or perspective, or makes the reader laugh and forget about something difficult in their life, then it is a great book. I am also partial to a gigantic photo on the back cover. I don’t know if that makes the inside of the book great, but it’s something I aspire to when I’m in my eighties.
